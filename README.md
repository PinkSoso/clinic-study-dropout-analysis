Data analysis project on discontinuation of clinical studies

This project analyzes clinical study dropout rates. The goal is to understand why patients drop out of clinical trials and identify factors that could help reduce dropout rates in future studies.
Data

The dataset used in this project comes from a variety of sources, including Kaggle. It contains records of clinical trials with information on patient demographics, study details, and reasons for dropout.
Objectives

The primary objective of this analysis is to:

- Analyze the dataset to identify trends and factors contributing to patient dropout.
- Explore relationships between different features (age, gender, study type, etc.) and the likelihood of dropout.
- Provide actionable insights to help reduce dropout rates in clinical trials.

Used libraries

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Results

After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and modeling, the key findings will be presented, including:

- Distribution of dropout rates by demographics and other factors.
- Insights into which factors most influence dropout rates.
- Recommendations on how to reduce dropout rates in clinical studies.
