# 🧪 Clinical Trial Dropout Analysis
Leveraging Data & AI to Improve Participant Retention - Healthcare Industry

## 📘 Executive Summary

In this project, I analyzed clinical trial participant data using **SQL, Python and Power BI** to understand and reduce participant dropout rates, a major challenge in clinical research.
I built an end-to-end analysis pipeline:

1. Extracted and structured trial data using **SQL**,
2. Explored participant behavior and dropout patterns using **Python**,
3. Designed interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to monitor key dropout indicators.

The analysis revealed critical dropout points during the trial lifecycle and identified high-risk participant profiles.
Based on these insights, I proposed data-driven and AI-supported recommendations to improve participant engagement and reduce attrition, ultimately leading to faster, more reliable and cost-effective clinical trials.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Clinical trials are a crucial step in the development of new drugs and medical treatments. However, one of the most significant challenges faced by researchers is the **high dropout rate** of participants before trial completion. This not only **delays research timelines**, but also **increases costs** and reduces the reliability of results.
High dropout rates is a real problem as it lead to : Delayed trial timelines, Increased operational and recruitment costs, Reduced statistical reliability of trial outcomes, Slower access to life-saving treatments.

The aim here is to support clinical research teams by using data and AI to:
- Understand when and why participants drop out,
- Detect early warning signals of dropout,
- Enable proactive interventions to improve retention.

With this project, we aim to contribute towards smarter, AI-assisted clinical research practices.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach & Methodology

- When and why do participants typically drop out of clinical trials?
- Are there any demographic or behavioral patterns behind high dropout rates?
- Can we build a **predictive model** to flag participants at risk of dropping out?
- What kind of interventions can reduce dropout rates?


- **SQL** query that extracts cleans and transforms the data from the database
- Build a dashboard in **Power BI** that tracks the number of oreders in each status
- Conducted a more detailed drop out analysis in **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to  stimulate changes and determine the best areas of opportunity
- **GitHub** for collaboration
