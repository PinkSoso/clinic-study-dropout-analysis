## 🎯 Business Problem
Clinical trials are a crucial step in the development of new drugs and medical treatments. However, one of the most significant challenges faced by researchers is the **high dropout rate** of participants before trial completion. This not only **delays research timelines**, but also **increases costs** and reduces the reliability of results.

In this project, we explore how **AI and data analysis** can be used to:
- Identify patterns and reasons for participant dropout,
- Predict potential dropouts early in the trial,
- Suggest proactive strategies to improve retention rates.

Our mission

- **Analyze clinical trial data** to study participant behavior and identify common dropout points.
- Use **data-driven insights** to suggest ways to improve participant engagement.
- Explore **machine learning models** to predict dropout risks during a study.

WHY ?
- Improving participant retention in clinical trials has real-world impact:
- Faster and more cost-effective trials
- More reliable results
- Quicker access to life-saving treatments

With this project, we aim to contribute towards smarter, AI-assisted clinical research practices.

## 🧠 Key Questions

- When and why do participants typically drop out of clinical trials?
- Are there any demographic or behavioral patterns behind high dropout rates?
- Can we build a **predictive model** to flag participants at risk of dropping out?
- What kind of interventions can reduce dropout rates?


## 🛠️ Methodology

- **SQL** query that extracts cleans and transforms the data from the database
- Build a dashboard in **Power BI** that tracks the number of oreders in each status
- Conducted a more detailed drop out analysis in **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to  stimulate changes and determine the best areas of opportunity
- **GitHub** for collaboration

 ## 📌 Skills
  - SQL : CTEs, Joins, Aggregate functions
  - Power BI : Dax, Writing Functions, ETL, Caluclated Columns, Data Visualization, Data Modelling
  - Python : Pandas, Matlplotlib, Numpy, Wrtiign Functions, Building a product funnel, Statistics
 

## 🗂️ Results & Business Recommendation



## 📊 Planned Steps

1. Import, clean and prepare the dataset.
2. Perform **exploratory data analysis** on dropout behavior.
3. Build **visualizations** to identify patterns.
4. Train a **machine learning model** to predict dropout risk.
5. Present findings with key takeaways and retention strategies.
